Fast 1vs1 "fighting-game like" game. This game is inspired on [One Step From Eden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/960690/One_Step_From_Eden/) and Mega Man Battle Network.

I started to develop this for learning purposes (mostly rendering and data oriented programming) and to possibly create a good, minimal FOSS game.

I started this codebase a few days earlier I created this repository. However, it was structured in a OOP-like way. I'm rewritting it in the previous mentioned paradigm.
